Hello and thank you for looking at the 3rd life recreation project here is what the pack has to offer!

first once you download it and put it into your world
you will get a message in your chat saying '3rd_life data pack successfully loaded!' in a light green color if the data pack is enabled.
then if you want to start the game use the command

`/function 3rd_life:start`
then everyone on the world or server will have a green name!
if you want to set someone to a specific color you first need to do the

`/function 3rd_life:start`
command then you can use these commands listed to change your color to green, yellow, and gray (spectator).

Green:
`/function 3rd_life:manual_team_change_green`

Yellow:
`/function 3rd_life:manual_team_change_yellow`

Red:
`/function 3rd_life:manual_team_change_red`

Spectator:
`/function 3rd_life:manual_team_change_spectator`

Spectator silent:
(Makes you a spectator without sound, and lightning)
`/function 3rd_life:manual_team_change_spectator_silent`

When you become a spectator everyone on the world/server will hear a wither death sound and a skeleton and lightning will spawn where you died!

Also credit to @grian on youtube for inspiring me to make this data pack.
